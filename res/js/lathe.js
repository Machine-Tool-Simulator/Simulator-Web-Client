If your component is cylindrically symmetric, a lathe is probably the machine that you will use to manufacture it.<br>The safety rules for the rest of the shop apply to the lathes as well.<br>1. Always wear safety glasses and a hat when operating any machinery in the shop.<br>2. However there are a few additional precautions that need to be taken when operating a lathe. First, make sure there are no loose items on your body that can get caught in the machine this includes items like watches bracelets necklaces and especially hair<br>3. The lathe will be spinning very fast during manufacturing and there are several protrusions on the lathe which can catch on hair and clothing. Never reach or lean into the work area when the machine is running.<br>4. In addition loading and unloading parts in the Chuck requires using a small square wrench to tighten the jaws. Never under any circumstances leave this wrench in the Chuck, not even for a moment. If the lane has accidentally started while the wrench is in the Chuck, the wrench will be flung out of the machine and could cause serious injury.<br>These are just some of the main safety concerns with the lathe there are others. Before using the lathe on your own, you will need to be trained by one of the shop staff."
